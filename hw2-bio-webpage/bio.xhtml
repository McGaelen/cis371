            Hi there, I'm currently a student at Grand Valley State University. My major is Computer Science.
            I currently work at Gordon Food Service as a UI Developer using Angular 2 and Typescript.
            I'm also a part of the GVSU Marching Band as well as the pep bands for GV Volleyball and Basketball.
        </p>

            I graduated from Holt High School in 2012. For my first two years of college, I went to Lansing Community
            College to get my gen eds out of the way.  In 2014, I transferred to Grand Valley, and declared CS as my major.
            I plan to graduate at the end of this school year (April 2018). My hope is that my current job will keep me on
            after graduation as full time.
        </p>
